   -- Replication tasks
   -- FlowGraphs
   
  --- Remote Source connection is required to create virtual table,
    -- Real time replication is possible
    
    --------------------
    
    FlowGraph -- creates a task in hana,
    
    
    -- Batch --  Stored procedure and task is created -- no restricions
    -- Real time -- Stored procedure and 2 tasks -- initial load + real time for changes
    -- Transactional -- no task for initial or batch upload, just one task..
    -- Procedure -- no task is created, just the stored procedure, many restrictions.

  Data Source -- > Projection  -- > Data target
     apply filter in Projection, also adjust mapping in the node.
     
  --- Aggregation
  
    Data Source -- > Projection -- > Aggregation -- > Data Target
